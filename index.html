<p>Electronic engineering is a sub-discipline of electrical engineering which utilizes active components such as semiconductor devices to amplify and control electric current flow in conjunction with passive electrical components, whereas electrical engineering only uses passive devices.

It covers such as: analog electronics, digital electronics, consumer electronics, embedded systems and power electronics. It is also involved in many related fields, for example solid-state physics, radio engineering, telecommunications, control systems, signal processing, systems engineering, computer engineering, instrumentation engineering, electric power control, robotics.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is one of the most important and influential organizations for electronics engineers based in the US; the equivalent body in the UK is the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). On an international level, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) publishes standards which include those for electronic engineering.</p>


<h2>History and development</h2>

  <p>Electronic engineering as a profession followed the identification of the electron in 1897, and the subsequent invention of the vacuum tube which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals. This inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age.[1] Practical applications started with the invention of the diode by Ambrose Fleming and the triode by Lee De Forest in the early 1900s, which made the detection of small electrical voltages such as radio signals from an radio antenna possible with a non-mechanical device. The growth of electronics was rapid. By the early 1920s, commercial radio broadcasting and communications were becoming widespread and electronic amplifiers were being used in such diverse applications as long distance telephony and the music recording industry.

The discipline was further enhanced by the large amount of electronic-systems development during World War II in such as radar and sonar, and the subsequent peace-time consumer revolution.</p>

<h2>Specialist areas</h2>

<p>Electronic engineering has many subfields. This section describes some of the most popular subfields in electronic engineering; although there are engineers who focus exclusively on one subfield, there are also many who focus on a combination of subfields.

Signal processing deals with the analysis and manipulation of signals. Signals can be either analog, in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or digital, in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information.

For analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the compression, error checking and error detection of digital signals.

Telecommunications engineering deals with the transmission of information across a channel such as a co-axial cable, optical fiber or free space.

Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier wave in order to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission, this is known as modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer.

Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a transceiver. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their power consumption as this is closely related to their signal strength. If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by noise.</p>


<p>Aviation-Electronic Engineering and Aviation-Telecommunications Engineering, They research and work on electronics and aerospace topics. Aviation-telecommunication engineers include a group of specialists who have a lot of information about the flight (such as meteorological data, some specific information, etc.) through the available platforms (such as AFTN, etc.) at the disposal of the aircraft itself or parts Others are stationed at airports. Specialists in this field mainly need knowledge of computer, networking, IT and physics.Their works are in organizations and companies in the air and space. Before, during and after the flight, the aircraft needs equipment and platforms that meet many of its needs such as navigation information, communication and monitoring systems (CNS). Of course, such equipment requires installation, commissioning, maintenance and repair, which is a serious task for an aviation electronics specialist at the airports. These courses are offered at different universities like Civil Aviation Technology College[2].[3]

Electromagnetics is an in-depth study about the signals that are transmitted in a channel (Wired or Wireless). This includes Basics of Electromagnetic waves, Transmission Lines and Waveguides, Antennas, its types and applications with Radio-Frequency (RF) and Microwaves. Its applications are seen widely in other sub-fields like Telecommunication, Control and Instrumentation Engineering.

Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airplanes to the cruise control present in many modern cars. It also plays an important role in industrial automation.

Control engineers often utilize feedback when designing control systems. For example, in a car with cruise control, the vehicle's speed is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the engine's power output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, control theory can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback.

Instrumentation engineering deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as pressure, flow and temperature. These devices are known as instrumentation.

The design of such instrumentation requires a good understanding of physics that often extends beyond electromagnetic theory. For example, radar guns use the Doppler effect to measure the speed of oncoming vehicles. Similarly, thermocouples use the Peltier–Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two points.</p>

<p>Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the sensors of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control engineering.[4]

Computer engineering deals with the design of computers and computer systems. This may involve the design of new computer hardware, the design of PDAs or the use of computers to control an industrial plant. Development of embedded systems—systems made for specific tasks (e.g., mobile phones)—is also included in this field. This field includes the micro controller and its applications. Computer engineers may also work on a system's software. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of software engineering, which is usually considered a separate discipline.

VLSI design engineering VLSI stands for very large scale integration. It deals with fabrication of ICs and various electronic components. In designing an integrated circuit, electronics engineers first construct circuit schematics that specify the electrical components and describe the interconnections between them. When completed, VLSI engineers convert the schematics into actual layouts, which map the layers of various conductor and semiconductor materials needed to construct the circuit.</p>
